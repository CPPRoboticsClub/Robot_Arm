# Weather-Station Workshop

The code is for Arduino (.ino) and uses the DHT and LiquidCrystal libraries.

The DHT library can be found here: https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library

The LiquidCrystal library comes pre-packaged with the Arduino IDE.

It was written for the Weather Station Workshop by the Cal Poly Pomona Robotics Club.
